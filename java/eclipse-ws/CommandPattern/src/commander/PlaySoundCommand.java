 * ----------------------
 * Represents a command.
 * Each command has a execute() method, as agreed upon by the interface.
 * This method gets called by the commander.
 * Within the execute() method the methods of the encapsulated receiver objects are called.
 * 
 * Here the receiver is, PlaySound.
 * Furthermore a state is given to the receiver, so that more sophisticated logic can be implemented.
